# matlabJkUtils
Utility functions for MATLAB (use at own risk)

NB: to be stored locally as a folder named `+JkUtils` (the `+` prefix is for MATLAB to recognize the folder as a package and github does not allow repo names to start with a `+`)

All functions should be documented (unless I forgot something) s.t. it's possible to run `help JkUtils.someFunc` from the matlab prompt to get function help.
